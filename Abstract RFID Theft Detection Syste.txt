**Abstract: RFID Theft Detection System Using Raspberry Pi Pico Zero with SHA-256.

The **RFID theft detection system** is a critical component of security infrastructure, aiming to protect assets and prevent unauthorized access. In this project, we propose an intelligent solution that combines the power of **Raspberry Pi Pico Zero**, **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing**, and **AI-based threat detection**. Here's an overview of our system:

1. **Hardware Setup**:
    - Utilize the **Raspberry Pi Pico Zero** as the central controller.
    - Connect an **RFID reader module (e.g., RC522)** to the Pico Zero.
    - Deploy **RGB LED indicators** for visual feedback.

2. **Software Development**:
    - **Install MicroPython** on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
    - Develop MicroPython code to:
        - Initialize the RFID reader.
        - Continuously read RFID data from tags.
        - Implement LED indicators for threat detection.

3. **Detection Algorithm**:
    - Define **threat signatures** associated with unauthorized access or tampering.
    - Compare read RFID data against these threat signatures.

4. **SHA-256 Integration**:
    - Generate **SHA-256 hashes** of RFID data for secure storage and comparison.
    - Verify data integrity using these hashes.

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
    - Test the system with different RFID tags (authorized and unauthorized).
    - Fine-tune parameters to minimize false positives/negatives.

6. **Deployment and Integration**:
    - Install the system at desired locations (entry/exit points, secure areas).
    - Integrate with existing security systems or databases.
